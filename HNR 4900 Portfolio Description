Artifact: honors class

***Description***
In my math modeling honors class freshman year, our final project was a partner project were we had to use Google Colab
in order to generate a research project of some type. My project partner was Julianne Kendrick, and she was very 
generous in allowing our project topic to be related to exercise science, which is my area of expertise (other than 
computer science). Within this project, we wanted to determine the relationship between the number of deadlifts one could
complete in one minute versus the weight of a dumbbell/kettlebell. Due to lack of time and resources, because of COVID
restrictions, Julianne and I worked to collect data based on my participation in the research. I used different weights, 
between 10 to 70 pounds and vice versa. When starting with heavier weight and decreasing the weight, it was noted that
more reps could be achieved as compared to starting with the lower weight and increasing. 



***Reflection and self-development***
Now that I am a senior, I have taken many core and elective exercise science classes and other than just common knowledge
of the result of this project, I now understand the scientific, physiological components of the why of our results. To me
even though this was just a little honors project, it made me interested in trying to figure out a way to combine my two 
passions: computer science and medicine. Because of this, the following semester I took a singular computer science course
and a singular exercise science course to ensure that that was the path I wanted, and sure enough, in May 2024, I will be 
able to walk the stage twice and grab my two B.S. degress in Computer Science with a Cybersecurity concentration and a
B.S. in Exercise Science.
